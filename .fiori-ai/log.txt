==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

A Fiori Elements application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their to-many associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the to-many associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

You help the user refining the DataModel for a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The DataModel consists of the following entities and associations:

Here is a list of property names, each with the property description that was extracted from previous user input:

PartyRequests_partyReason: Dropdown options: Birthday, Wedding, Corporate Event, Private Gathering, Festival
PartyRequests_date: Date picker for selecting the event date
PartyRequests_location: Text input for specifying the event location
PartyRequests_adults: Number input for specifying the number of adults
PartyRequests_includeChildren: Checkbox to indicate if children are included
PartyRequests_children: Number input for specifying the number of children, visible only if includeChildren is true
PartyRequests_totalGuests: Read-only field automatically calculated as the sum of adults and children
PartyRequests_foodOptions: Multi-select checkbox group options: Vegan, Vegetarian, Meat/Fish, Fingerfood, Dessert buffet
PartyRequests_drinkOptions: Multi-select checkbox group options: Soft drinks, Beer, Wine, Cocktails
PartyRequests_extraServices: Multi-select checkbox group options: DJ, Decoration, Service staff
Calculations_plates: Calculated result for the number of plates needed
Calculations_glasses: Calculated result for the number of glasses needed

Calculations_paperCups: Calculated result for the number of paper cups needed
Calculations_paperPlates: Calculated result for the number of paper plates needed
Calculations_disposableCutlery: Calculated result for the number of disposable cutlery sets needed

For each property analyze the description with respect to what property values can be expected.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

==========LLM call for step "extractColors":==========
You help the user creating a Fiori Elements application based on user input describing such an application.
Your task is to determine whether the entity properties can be considered good and bad in most contexts or are usually neutral. When in doubt, set to neutral.

These are the entity properties and their values:
Entity: PartyRequests, Property: partyReason, Values: Birthday, Wedding, Corporate Event, Private Gathering, Festival
Entity: PartyRequests, Property: includeChildren, Values: true, false
Entity: PartyRequests, Property: foodOptions, Values: Vegan, Vegetarian, Meat/Fish, Fingerfood, Dessert buffet
Entity: PartyRequests, Property: drinkOptions, Values: Soft drinks, Beer, Wine, Cocktails
Entity: PartyRequests, Property: extraServices, Values: DJ, Decoration, Service staff

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "PartyRequests" - Properties:
    partyReason: String(50), Dropdown options: Birthday, Wedding, Corporate Event, Private Gathering, Festival
    date: Date, Date picker for selecting the event date
    location: String(100), Text input for specifying the event location
    adults: Integer, Number input for specifying the number of adults
    includeChildren: String(50), Checkbox to indicate if children are included
    children: Integer, Number input for specifying the number of children, visible only if includeChildren is true
    totalGuests: Integer, Read-only field automatically calculated as the sum of adults and children
    foodOptions: String(100), Multi-select checkbox group options: Vegan, Vegetarian, Meat/Fish, Fingerfood, Dessert buffet
    drinkOptions: String(100), Multi-select checkbox group options: Soft drinks, Beer, Wine, Cocktails
    extraServices: String(100), Multi-select checkbox group options: DJ, Decoration, Service staff

Entity "Calculations" - Properties:
    plates: Integer, Calculated result for the number of plates needed
    glasses: Integer, Calculated result for the number of glasses needed
    cutlery: Integer, Calculated result for the number of cutlery sets needed
    paperCups: Integer, Calculated result for the number of paper cups needed
    paperPlates: Integer, Calculated result for the number of paper plates needed
    disposableCutlery: Integer, Calculated result for the number of disposable cutlery sets needed
    partyRequests_partyReason: String(50), partyReason of associated PartyRequests

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"PartyRequests.csv":"partyReason;date;location;adults;includeChildren;children;totalGuests;foodOptions;drinkOptions;extraServices","Calculations.csv":"plates;glasses;cutlery;paperCups;paperPlates;disposableCutlery;partyRequests_partyReason"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.

Use format for values:
  Date: 2021-06-27
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
  Integer, Double: only numbers, no special symbols

For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- partyReason (of PartyRequests): Birthday, Wedding, CorporateEvent, PrivateGathering, Festival
- includeChildren (of PartyRequests): true, false
- foodOptions (of PartyRequests): Vegan, Vegetarian, Meat/Fish, Fingerfood, Dessertbuffet
- drinkOptions (of PartyRequests): Softdrinks, Beer, Wine, Cocktails
- extraServices (of PartyRequests): DJ, Decoration, Servicestaff
